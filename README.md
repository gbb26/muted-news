## Introduction

This React application fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays it using an infinite scroll component. The data is presented in a card format, each card displaying a user's information.

## Components

### `FetchData.jsx`

This component handles fetching data from the API and rendering it with infinite scrolling.

### `App.jsx`

The main component that sets up the routing for the application.

### `Card.jsx`

A functional component that renders a user card with their information.

### `Details.jsx`

A component to display details about a user. It receives props for image URL, user ID, username, and description.
